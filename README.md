# Manga Scraping
Scraping baka-updates on lambda to receive custom news letter on the series I like.
Adds links pointing to likely link of the release.
Main is located in lambda_function.

##Installation:

As Google CSE only permits 100 requests per day. There is only so much manga that can be followed.

##Deployement
TODO Cloud Formation to ease reuse
